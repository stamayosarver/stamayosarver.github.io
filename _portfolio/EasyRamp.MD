# What is TOM

*Tikkun Olam Makers (TOM)* is a global movement that aims to address various social and environmental challenges through innovation and technology. "Tikkun Olam" translates to "repairing the world" in Hebrew, reflecting the organization's mission to contribute to societal improvement and sustainability. TOM brings together engineers, designers, innovators, and problem solvers in collaborative efforts to develop open-source solutions that assist people living with disabilities, older people, and those facing other daily challenges.

TOM's approach is unique because it focuses on creating custom solutions for individual needs, which are often overlooked by the commercial market due to lack of profitability. These solutions can range from customized prosthetics, assistive devices, and adaptive tools for learning and communication to environmental innovations. One of the key aspects of TOM's model is their "Makeathons," intensive workshops where teams work together to prototype solutions to specific challenges presented by individuals or communities.

By fostering a community of makers and volunteers, Tikkun Olam Makers leverages collective intelligence and open-source collaboration to improve people's lives while promoting a culture of social responsibility and innovation. Their work exemplifies how technology and creativity can be harnessed for social good, embodying the spirit of "Tikkun Olam" by striving to make the world a better place for all.
