# **Multi-material Printing**

Multimaterial printing uses different materials to 3D print something in one 3D print process. Multi-material printing enables the embedding of materials into a part for the on-spot creation of functional products without the need for welding, screws, or rivets of any kind. This material or mechanism embedding enables easy creation of products and opens up new potential tool designs that conventional rivets, welding, screws, and other methods of containing a product restrict. 

### Multi-material printing and injection molding integration

Multimaterial printing, in conjunction with injection molding, allows for the integration of a wide range of materials for both the 3D print and injection mold.


> Moulded, 3D printed components, make it possible to implement geometries that are only possible with 3D printing in combination with the larger choice of available materials in the area of injection moulding, as all iglidur materials can be selected.

##  **Advantages, Challenges, and current Market**

Multimaterial printing enables a great degree of freedom in customization and complexity compared to other manufacturing processes. This is especially true for industries that require a high degree of customization, such as healthcare and aerospace, as well as spaces for tailored products, like the automotive industry and the ‘modding’ community. The additional complexity and degree of freedom come with a cost – a significant increase in production costs, assuming other manufacturing techniques can achieve the desired geometries. However, regardless of the complexity of the design, and in contrary to the high production costs — multi-material printing mostly maximizes materials usage. The way a printer works maximized materials usage by printing materials only where they are needed without the necessity of techniques to encapsulate, like conventional rivets, welding, screws, and other methods. Simply put, multi-material printing can maximize materials and drive down material costs. However, the maximization of materials is only enabled with a deep understanding of materials and 3D printing, without knowing what temperature and spacing are needed between materials to get good adhesion. Furthermore, without knowledge of the conditions for each material, the printing itself can create a mess and potentially a hazard. The combination of materials, if there is an understanding of how to combine them, opens up new avenues in the rapid prototyping and testing process — as multi-material printing can be used to speed up product development through the creation of multi-material prototypes quickly and effectively. However, a deep understanding of material science and the limits of the printing process can create a barrier that prevents multi-material printing in rapid prototyping. Finally, multi-material printing offers something most manufacturing technologies do not provide — functional on-spot prints. This assumes that the 3D printer is functioning. 3d printers are still developing in technology, so maintaining the printer remains a full-time job for many 3D printing enthusiasts (like myself with my dumb Cr-10S pro v2). To summarize, multi-material printing enables a high degree of freedom, material efficiency, innovative design testing, and ready-to-use products off the print bed; however, this process is costly, and an understanding of the material science, multi-material printing, and how to properly maintain the 3D printer limits the versatility of multi-material printing in the market. 

The advantages and challenges of multi-material printing are summarized in the table below…

| Advantages                            | Challenges|
|:----------------------------------|:---------|
| Customizability and complexity         | High costs       |
| Material Efficiency            |Material science problms|
| Innovative design testing            | Multi-material design complexities      |
| Functionality on spot         |  Process and maintenance |


By jumping through the hurdle that is a material science, multi-material design, and multi-material process knowledge gap I can be one step closer to potentially employing multi-material printing in my future endeavors.

## My project

The creation of ready-to-use multi-material pliers in Dr. David Florian’s Additive and Polymer-manufacturing Technologies class (CHBE 4200) involved being put into the unknown and learning multi-material printing, designing, and material science. The multi-material-pliers design is pictured at the top and included below.

Below are two 3D models—model 1 is the design for the class multi-material printer to print, and model 2 is an alternative model for integrating two 3D prints using a standard FDM 3D printer.
