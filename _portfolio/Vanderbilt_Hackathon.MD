# Introduction

Vanderbilt has the incredible opportunity to offer a Vanderbilt Hackathon --- a competition where students compete in groups of four to create a progem, webpage, or app that suits a specific theme while using a sponsor's endpoints or software. 

My team consisted of Ryan, Bruce, and Harry, as well as myself.

After a ideation session lasting over breakfast we determined that we wanted to make a financial aid advisor --- we then got to work planning the intricacies of the project. 

The idea was simple: many people who how helpful ChatGPT is and, especially in private companies,  upload important legal documents and/or the various financial data around the idea of using ChatGPT as a financial advisor. We wanted to solve this problem and further, as we discussed, make it easier to use for everyone. Not just millenials that use Chat GPT,  but also for the less technically capable.

After a full day of writing things out on a whiteboard, we determined 3 key things

1. After an initial connection to our system and connection of our system using Plaid and Auth0 we would use email as our line of communication 
2. We would use Perplexity Pro's API to the best of our ability -- not only was it a sponser of the Hackathon but using a simple PDF reader it is on par if not better than the current stuff out on Gemini (update: excluding Gemini 2.0) 
3. It would be able to use Perplexity's ability of looking up information and use the person's financial data to properly act as a personal financial advisor.

We wanted to accomplish a couple of things with this project --- that is, we saw a lot of our competitors and see that a lot of the things on the Market are using GPTs on the web browser/interface
