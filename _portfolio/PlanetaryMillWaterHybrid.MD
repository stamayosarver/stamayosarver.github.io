# Revolutionizing Recycling - The Mayfield Project

## Abstract

Plastic management is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. Our project predicts that by creating better practices, processes, or machines, we can effectively recycle plastic, turning it into a reusable resource. This endeavor requires a comprehensive understanding and a multifaceted approach.


## Introduction

The Mayfield project aims to create a meaningful impact on Vanderbilt Campus by tackling the major, unaddressed problem of recycling. Our team is passionate about developing efficient ways to recycle plastic.

## Hypothesis

By focusing on creating or developing processes or machines with cross-disciplinary teams, we believe the seemingly unfeasible task of efficient plastic recycling will become feasible.

## Mayfield Project Statement

Our project focuses on addressing the issue of unprocessed recycling and trash prevalence within our community, developing a hybrid machine-human sorting system, and showcasing our project's success to solve significant environmental issues.

## Key Foundational Idea

Recycling is the best option for managing waste, superior to incineration and chemical-engineered solutions.

## Theoretical Framework by Samuel Tamayo-Sarver

The use of a multistep process incorporating size reduction via a planetary mill with water to exploit plastics' hydrophobic and buoyant properties is proposed. This innovative approach could revolutionize the recycling and processing of plastic materials.

# Theoretical Device Designs



## Recyling sorter/ powder recyler for powder bed fusion 3D printers

Interestingly, the genesis of my idea originated from an external source. During a brief visit to Dr. Hanusa's mechanochemical laboratory, I encountered my source of inspiration: the planetary milling machine. This device has a fascinating application; it blends materials by overcoming static friction through a reverse rotational motion. Moreover, in many planetary mills, not exclusively in Dr. Hanusa's lab, spherical media within the cylindrical chambers are employed to pulverize materials into extremely fine particles.

My proposition aims to tackle a critical global challenge: plastic recycling. Given that plastic will remain a prevalent material for the foreseeable future, my theory focuses on utilizing this innovative mechanical process to enhance recycling methods.

Please see an simple drawing for the premise behind this theory

I can only speculate that a pseudo-design centered around the focus of rotational motion overcoming frictional forces will work for proper separation of powder from the part. At the end of the day, these are two completely different uses; the separation of powder is not even close to a way of mechanochemical mixing. However, the baseline idea in both cases is that the multi-rotational movement can separate fine particles and overcome the attractive forces between finer and less fine (objectively) objects.
	A conceptual model can be created to validate my idea on the microscale…this may become an integral part of the Mayfield Project for next year.
