## Abstract

Plastic management is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. Our project predicts that by creating better practices, processes, or machines, we can effectively recycle plastic, turning it into a reusable resource. This endeavor requires a comprehensive understanding and a multifaceted approach.

## Our goal

The Mayfield project aims to create a meaningful impact on Vanderbilt Campus by tackling the major, unaddressed problem of recycling. Our team is passionate about developing better processes for a large impact on recylcing in the world.

### Carbon Credit Marketplace

A platform that facilitates the trading of carbon credits between entities looking to offset their carbon emissions and those involved in projects that generate verifiable emission reductions.

#### What are carbon credits?

Carbon credits represent the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon dioxide (or another greenhouse gas) that has been reduced, avoided, or removed from the atmosphere.

#### How does it work?

The marketplace operates on the principle of supply and demand. Project developers, such as renewable energy producers, forestry initiatives, and carbon capture projects, list their carbon credits on the platform. Businesses and organizations looking to offset their emissions can then purchase these credits.

#### User Roles

- **Sellers (Project Developers)**: Can register, create profiles, list carbon credits with details and pricing, upload verification documents, manage transactions, and communicate with buyers.
- **Buyers (Businesses and Organizations)**: Can browse listings, filter by project type, location, and price, securely purchase credits, view transaction history, and access carbon offset documentation.

#### Core Functionalities

- **Platform Architecture**: Web-based platform with features like user authentication, listing management, search and filtering, secure transactions, and verification mechanisms.
- **Verification Process**: Partnering with third-party verifiers, integrating with existing verification standards, implementing document review processes, and assigning verification status to projects.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizing blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions, immutable record-keeping, and unique digital tokens representing carbon credits.
- **Data Analytics and Reporting**: Providing valuable insights through market trends, carbon offset impact reports, and user dashboards.
- **User Experience and Interface**: Offering intuitive interfaces, data visualization tools, and mobile applications for easy access.
- **Security Measures**: Implementing robust security protocols like data encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits.
- **Compliance and Legal Considerations**: Adhering to relevant regulations, KYC/AML procedures, and clear terms of service and privacy policies.
- **Improvement**: Incorporating user feedback, regular feature updates, and staying informed about advancements in carbon credit methodologies.

#### Benefits of Using the Platform

- **Increased transparency and trust**: Blockchain technology ensures secure and verifiable transactions.
- **Streamlined process**: Efficient platform facilitates easy buying and selling of carbon credits.
- **Wider reach**: Connects project developers with a broader pool of potential buyers.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Lowers transaction costs compared to traditional carbon markets.
- **Environmental impact**: Contributes to positive environmental change by encouraging emission reduction projects.

This platform can be a valuable tool in the fight against climate change by enabling businesses and organizations to offset their carbon footprint and support sustainable development initiatives.

## Theoretical Framework by Samuel Tamayo-Sarver

The use of a multistep process incorporating size reduction via a planetary mill with water to exploit plastics' hydrophobic and buoyant properties is proposed. This innovative approach could revolutionize the recycling and processing of plastic materials. -->

# Theoretical Device Designs

## Recyling sorter/ powder recyler for powder bed fusion 3D printers

Interestingly, the genesis of my idea originated from an external source. During a brief visit to Dr. Hanusa's mechanochemical laboratory, I encountered my source of inspiration: the planetary milling machine. This device has a fascinating application; it blends materials by overcoming static friction through a reverse rotational motion. Moreover, in many planetary mills, not exclusively in Dr. Hanusa's lab, spherical media within the cylindrical chambers are employed to pulverize materials into extremely fine particles.

My proposition aims to tackle a critical global challenge: plastic recycling. Given that plastic will remain a prevalent material for the foreseeable future, my theory focuses on utilizing this innovative mechanical process to enhance recycling methods.

Please see an simple drawing for the premise behind this theory

A commercial Planetary Mill can be seen below:

For more on Doctor Hanusa’s Lab’s usage of planetary mills visit 'MECHANOCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS AND COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF ORGANO-MAIN GROUP SPECIES WITH DELOCALIZED LIGANDS By Ross Forrest Koby' "

I can only speculate that a pseudo-design centered around the focus of rotational motion overcoming frictional forces will work for proper separation of powder from the part. At the end of the day, these are two completely different uses; the separation of powder is not even close to a way of mechanochemical mixing. However, the baseline idea in both cases is that the multi-rotational movement can separate fine particles and overcome the attractive forces between finer and less fine (objectively) objects.
	A conceptual model can be created to validate my idea on the microscale…this may become an integral part of the Mayfield Project for next year.
