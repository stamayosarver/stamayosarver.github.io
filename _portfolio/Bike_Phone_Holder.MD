## Introduction to Rapid Prototyping

Rapid Prototyping is the process of quickly making a baseline prototype, proof of concept, or minimum viable product; however, 3D printing a whole prototype or product is not a quick process at all and can take days or weeks even to assemble. So what makes "Rapid Prototyping" so rapid?

### What makes Rapid Prototyping so 'Rapid'?

Rapid prototyping is so rapid not because of the speed of fabricating prototypes with manufacturing techniques but because of the speed of creating full assemblies and finished products digitally. The "Rapid" part of Rapid Prototyping does not happen in the physical manufacturing of the prototype but rather in the creation of easy-to-modify designs in 3D modeling software. I have spent countless hours in primarily one 3D modeling software --- Fusion 360. Fusion 360 enables parameterization and components to make easily changeable designs and drafts. Once a design is chosen and tested, Fusion 360 offers a generative design modeling platform to make a final product that is lightweight, stronger, and cost-effective much quicker than traditional methods. 

## An introduction to Top-Down Modeling

One such technique to create parts really quickly is a methodology called Top Down Modeling (TDM), TDM is an insanely great method to create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) or proof of concept quickly and cost-effectively. Top Down Modeling is the use of a primary (top) sketch and then the addition of more sketches and components after that primary sketch to get one coherent parameterized design. This enables a functional assembly and the ability to change each specific part within the assembly. 

See the image below to reference this process.

## Using Top-Down Modeling for Phone Holder Attachment on a Bike

Top-down modeling was utilized to gain a greater understanding of how to make an assembly work, knowing the relationships between its components and the assembly's end vision. This project was meant to be an introduction to Top-Down Modeling, and as such, I learned a lot about how I process things as with most things in life. I learned the hard way. My first design took a grueling amount of time despite its overall simplicity. This is mainly because I needed an overarching design in mind. I found out through this assignment that the quickest way I digitally prototype is by creating an unconstrained, free-flowing body off of paper sketches and then refining that simple design. Afterward, I start from scratch and can Top Down model the design I have in mind very quickly with parameters, constraints, and the manufacturing processes into account. My first design is pictured below, followed by my second. I have found that starting simple and adding details with complexity at the end is the best way to model things using Top Down Modeling.

## My design and choices

There are three aspects important to my design: 
* The personalized Phone holder 
* The joint ability 
* The handlebar adjustment mechanism 

# The Phone Holder

I opted to use TPU in my design of the phone holder, the TPU is a perfect material to grasp onto my phone and because of rapid prototyping I tested out the fit between the holder and my phone very quickly through the creation of a test model. I then adjusted accordingly to get a perfect fit. Ther main aspect of the phone holder other than the cool grip pictured below.

> Grip On

The second aspect of the phone holder is how it is attached to the central joint, my phone case, pictured below, features a special indented space near the middle of the phone. This indented area was perfect for the height of the M5 screw that was used to attach the grip to the joint. Preferably, a magnetic washer would be used, however, without any washer large enough, I simply 3D printed one out of PLA. Regardless, the screw doubled as a magnet to further hold onto the phone and provide a hidden force to hold the phone. See the picture below:

The last aspect to mention is the provided area for the volume and power buttons, pictured below:

# The Joint ability

The joint comprises three parts, the phone grip/holder, this small cylinder, and the area built into the handlebar connection to hold the pieces together.

The idea behind the joint is that the TPU sleeve area that is a part of the grip/phone holder would provide enough friction. See below for pictures around the joint.

# Conclusion
### To summarize, I found a 4 part top modeling integrated approach made my worktimes quick and efficient: 

1. Sketch up the design on paper and create a mock part in Fusion 360
2. Decide which parts to manufacture or order online. Mainly decide on the type of materials and the constraints for designing around them
3. Top-down model each component of the assembly, making sure each component is parameterized and the timeline is kept consistent testing parts for fits if possible. Use dummy component prototype whenever possible
4. Manufacture a prototype version using both in and out-of-house manufacturing facilities

5. An optional 5th option presents itself as I dive deeper into generative modeling, which is bringing the assembly from to the generative modeling workspace to make the part lightweight, cost-efficient, and stronger than the original model.
