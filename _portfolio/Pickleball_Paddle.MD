# Why a Pickleball paddle

A pickleball paddle has many very similar features to hand tools and industrial manufacturing tools: a grip, handle, and end for a specific purpose. This can be akin to making a hand tool or tool for something specific. Intentionally, making a Pickleball paddle quickly would be a testament to my learnings as a 3D designer and to my Fusion 360 skills. 

The pickleball paddle starts with a design modeled of actual pickleball paddles, as pictured below.
