# Why a Pickleball paddle

A pickleball paddle has many very similar features to hand tools and industrial manufacturing tools: a grip, handle, and end for a specific purpose. This can be akin to making a hand tool or tool for something specific. Intentionally, making a Pickleball paddle quickly would be a testament to my learnings as a 3D designer and to my Fusion 360 skills. 

The pickleball paddle starts with a design modeled of actual pickleball paddles, as pictured below.

The end model is pictured below

There are 3 main things that were considered in my design choices and production. (1) Mass distribution, (2) Grip, and (3) Protective coat

1. Mass distribution

The printed infill was calculated very specifically, with the total volume being found in Fusion 360 and then taking an infill percentage to get the desired weight distribution and center of mass. The table below shows the initial (completely filled weight), followed by the (infill percentage), and then the ending weight post-print.

The four parts that were printed were thr Grip, Protection, Paddle surface, and Handle. The Grip and Protection both used TPU 95A. The Handle and Paddle used PLA. Using the volume from Fusion 360 and the densities of PLA and TPU I got a theoretical mass of each component. Pictured in the table below

2. Grip

The grip was a simple yet regal design, with my thinking being a childhood plastic sword I used to play with, where the grip was out onto the handle and then the handle onto the tool. My childhood sword's end was a blade, and this design is a pickleball paddle's paddle designed off a professional pickleball paddle from Amazon. Silding on the grip onto the handle it fits like a sleeve --- The only problem with my design is that once it is on, there is no getting it off. I broke my paddle trying to take the grip-sleeve off of the handle. The contour of the handle end makes it very easy to put on and very difficult to take off.

3. Protective guard

The protective guard is a super simple, replaceable guard for the pickleball paddle. My design is quite simplistic: a snap-on fit that protects from all hazards because it is connected to the entirety of the paddle's perimeter. Interestingly enough, this protective coating fits on the paddle just perfectly. However, getting dirt in the guard will make it harder to put on, and it will not stay on in the event of a collision. A glue or adhesive can be applied for a semi-permanent stick, but 3D printing a new guard is the best replacement in the event that the guard is deformed.
