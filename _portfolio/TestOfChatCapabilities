## Introduction to Microfluidic Devices

Microfluidic devices are a groundbreaking invention that has shifted the field of chemistry, biology, and diagnostics. These simple devices integrate one or several laboratory functions on a single chip smaller than the size of an iPod. A microfluidic device uses microchannels ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. These microchannels enable the precise control and manipulation of fluids at a microscale. The critical functionality of microfluidic devices is the ability to create homogeneous mixing of fluids. A homogeneous, laminar flow mixing process is essential for specific chemical reactions, biological assays, drug delivery systems, and biomedical diagnostic devices.

>"Moreover, the 2-D format of this generalized digital architecture can be adapted via voltage-control software for highly-parallel operation, with reaction-based microdrop mixing, splitting, routing, etc., being carried out simultaneously at multiple on-chip locations. Such digital microfluidic implementations are now being applied to immunoassays (Alphonsus et al., 2010), DNA ligations (which are very sensitive to reagent economy) (Liu et al., 2008), and DNA pyrosequencing (Fair et al., 2007)." — "Digital microfluidics technologies for biomedical devices" in Microfluidic Devices for Biomedical Applications

## The Challenge of Microfluidic Device Fabrication

However, these microfluidic devices have been very hard to manufacture until recent discoveries and industry developments. See an excerpt of an article below:

> “Fabrication of microfluidic devices by photolithography generally requires specialized training and access to a cleanroom. As an alternative, 3D printing enables cost-effective fabrication of microdevices with complex features that would be suitable for many biomedical applications.” — “Rapid prototyping of cell culture microdevices using parylene-coated 3D prints” in Lab on a Chip

## Application Requiring Homogeneous Mixing

An important application where laminar mixing is pivotal is preparing reaction mixtures for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification, and more specifically, a reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out within the microfluidic system.

## Challenges of Mixing in Microfluidics

In microfluidic devices, achieving effective mixing poses significant challenges due to maintaining the laminar flow that dominates at this scale. Unlike turbulent (or chaotic) flow, where chaotic instabilities create the mixing, laminar flow uses diffusion between orderly layers of fluid to mix. As a result, in microfluidics, the goal of creating geometric shape-specific channels is key to efficient and effective mixing.

## Mixing Strategies in Microfluidics

There are primarily two types of mixing in microfluidics — Active and Passive mixing. This device entails only passive mixing, utilizing geometric features within the microchannels to enhance mixing efficiency.

## Considerations for Efficiency

In "Fundamentals and Applications of Microfluidics" by Nam Trung Nguyen, several properties are crucial when designing a microfluidic device, including kinematic, transport, thermodynamic, and miscellaneous properties.

### Dimensions and Shapes

The efficiency of these designs depends on the dimensions, shapes, and space within the channels. For instance, in a zigzag microchannel, the width (w) and the step size (s) are crucial parameters for enhancing mixing efficiency.
