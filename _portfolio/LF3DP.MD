# Features

* **Linear Actuator Action** Built with a linear actuator that controls the motion of the syringe pump using a reverse thread and right thread system.
* **Concise Volume Amount** The holders for the syringe bottles can fit different types of syringes, meaning a different syringe can be used for a different desired volume.  
* **Controlled Volume Output** By customizing the rate of the linear actuator, the volume released by the syringe pump can also be controlled. Enabling the user to use the linear actuator for both high volume output and low volume output.
