# **Generative Design**

The Generative Design page in Fusion 360 is a super powerful tool for making an object lightweight, cost-efficient, and strong for the desired purpose. It is part of Fusion 360 and should be utilized after a primary prototype is created. 

Knowledge of how to operate the Generative Design tool in Fusion 360 is essential. I learned to follow along in the Fusion 360 tutorial. If you also want to follow along please see this website:

Applying my skills to something new and unguided, I was tasked to use generative modeling to create a skateboard truck to hold the back wheels and the motor. Please see the image below:

Using Generative Design I arrived to the following 3D Model:

# A Unique Pairing

Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printing, can be coupled with Generative Design for limitless possibilities. This pack-a-punch combo enables the in-house creation of complex, lightweight, and strong components unattainable by other traditional manufacturing methods. This unique pairing has immense opportunities in aerospace, automotive, and research and development of manufacturing companies.

## What is Generative Design?

Generative Design uses AI-driven modeling and algorithms to create possible solutions given certain forces and constraints.

Generative Design can be summarized as a 5-step process:
1. **Geometry** - identify the geometry that will be preserved, that which will be an obstacle, and create any known areas to fill space.
2. **Study Details** - set the manufacturing methods, the design objectives, and the safety factor.
3. **Loads and Constraints** - set loads and constraints, what will move and what will be pivoted, and by how much force.
4. **Generation** - create the study and explore models.
5. **Selection** - select a model or regenerate after altering the safety factor.

### Why would you use Generative Design?

Generative Design is powerful because the algorithm creates many solutions that consider material properties, forces being applied, weight specifications, performance requirements, and manufacturing technology. Given unrestricted modeling, the algorithm goes crazy to create designs that a human designer might not consider. At the same time, the algorithm looks to optimize weight, material usage, and structural integrity. This is especially impactful for the aviation, automotive, and aerospace industries. In these industries, optimizing weight and structural integrity is essential to decreasing the weight and reducing the amount of gas being used per trip. This optimization is extremely impactful for the effectiveness of the product. The premium opportunity that generative AI offers is insanely great for product development in any industry where optimization is necessary.

### How does Generative Design Work?

Generative Design is an iterative process that harnesses algorithm-based software to generate numerous designs based on constraints like material properties, performance requirements, and weight specifications. The primary utility of Generative Design lies in its ability to explore the vast design space that a human designer might not consider, efficiently finding solutions that optimize weight, material usage, and structural integrity. This approach is useful and could be regarded as essential for industries like aerospace, where weight is a premium concern. It has been instrumental in designing parts that balance strength and weight, resulting in fuel-efficient aircraft with a reduced carbon footprint.

### What are some drawbacks of Generative Design?

There are some drawbacks to Generative Design. The main drawback is that the ability of Generative Design to explore solutions is restricted by manufacturing methods—such methods as filament 3D printing, injection molding, and laser cutting—which may hinder the ability of the Generative Design Algorithm. In addition, Generative Design can be costly, especially for non-educational users. For Fusion 360, it costs $25 for each generation and $100 to export a model from the study. Additionally, Generative Design is very limited by knowledge of the forces applied. It is crucial to know what type of force, at what degree, at what angle, and which specific parts it affects. It may be a hindering factor in the ability of Generative Design.

## The Revolutionary Manufacturing method: Powder Bed Fusion (PBF)

PBF offers a unique additive manufacturing opportunity when coupled with generative AI, where the generative AI can be set to 'unrestrictive' given the ability of the PBF to print pretty much anywhere in the powder. PFG uses thermal energy to selectively fuse regions of a powder bed, and the powder then supports the fused powder parts, meaning that the print can produce complex geometries with essentially no wasted material as support. In other words, PBF's unique manufacturing ability to print virtually any object without support material gives leeway. It resolves Generative Design restrictions using the manufacturing method. The digital models outputted by the Generative Design, given PBF's cool manufacturing freedom, have insane weight optimization and the toughness of materials like Nylon 12 and ALSi10Mg. The combination of PBF with Generative Design is a unique combination capable of making strong, lightweight, and cost-effective geometries.

Furthermore, the iterative nature of Generative Design aligns well with PBF's rapid prototyping capabilities. Designs can be quickly manufactured, tested, and refined in successive iterations, creating a feedback loop that can rapidly hone in on optimal design solutions. Generative Design coupled with PBF can lead to optimal solutions for complex problems by minimizing weight. This is especially true in automotive and aerospace, where Generative Design can optimize the car’s chassis for crashworthiness while minimizing weight. When combined with PBF's capacity to produce these complex structures, this results in vehicles that are both safer and more fuel-efficient. This easy integration between PBF, Generative Design, and rapid prototyping makes for a very quick development process and prototyping—essential for fast-paced industries like automotive and startups, where time-to-market and creating the MVP the quickest are critical factors.

## A Knowledge Gap

To summarize, Generative Design is powerful especially with PBF, where the cost to produce complex geometry is virtually the same as for simple geometry. However, it's critical to recognize that Generative Design is not easy. It requires a deep understanding of the materials, processes, and forces involved. The largest limit to Generative Design is the knowledge of the designer, without proper knowledge of the forces involved, the results will not be great. Furthermore, if the designer can not interpret and refine the output of the generation with the regulatory and functional requirements in mind, Generative Design is not worth any investment. This is part of the reason I want to work as a private prototype/product designer over the summer of 2024 - offering a physical proof of concept using my 3D printer, given that I will be getting paid to take your idea and make it into a reality and more importantly learn crucial aspects to rapid prototyping and designing.

## Conclusion

The unique combo of Generative Design and powder bed fusion presents a transformative opportunity for the aerospace and automotive industries. It enables the quick and cost-efficient manufacturing of parts and components that are lighter, stronger, and more efficient than those produced by conventional methods. This combo has shortcomings in challenges in terms of manufacturing practicality and the need for expert oversight. However, the benefits are super appealing. As computational power grows and understanding of these technologies deepens, Generative Design is going to grow. I can even see Generative Design becoming a standard in design and manufacturing in the future.
