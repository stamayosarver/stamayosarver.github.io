# **Generative Design**

The Generative Design page in Fusion 360 is a super powerful tool for making an object lightweight, cost-efficient, and strong for the desired purpose. It is part of Fusion 360 and should be utilized after a primary prototype is created. 

Knowledge of how to operate the Generative Design tool in Fusion 360 is essential. I learned to follow along in the Fusion 360 tutorial. If you also want to follow along please see this website: https://www.autodesk.com/learn/ondemand/course/fusion360-generative-design-intro-expert/module/3OKXgzHoU9V26MGcH5lAOe

Applying my skills to something new and unguided, I was tasked to use generative modeling to create a skateboard truck to hold the back wheels and the motor. Please see the image below:

# A Unique Pairing

Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printing, can be coupled with generative Design for limitless possibilities. This pack-a-punch combo enables the in-house creation of complex, lightweight, and strong components unattainable by other traditional manufacturing methods. This unique pairing has immense opportunities in aerospace, automotive, and research and development of manufacturing companies.

## What is Generative Design?

Generative Design uses AI-driven modeling and algorithms to create possible solutions given certain forces and constraints.

Generative Design can be summarized as a 5-step process:
1. **Geometry** - identify the geometry that will be preserved, that which will be an obstacle, and create any known areas to fill space.
2. **Study Details** - set the manufacturing methods, the design objectives, and the safety factor.
3. **Loads and Constraints** - set loads and constraints, what will move and what will be pivoted, and by how much force.
4. **Generation** - create the study and explore models.
5. **Selection** - select a model or regenerate after altering the safety factor.

### Why would you use Generative Design?

Generative Design is powerful because the algorithm creates many solutions that consider material properties, forces being applied, weight specifications, performance requirements, and manufacturing technology. Given unrestricted modeling, the algorithm goes crazy to create designs that a human designer might not consider. At the same time, the algorithm looks to optimize weight, material usage, and structural integrity. This is especially impactful for the aviation, automotive, and aerospace industries. In these industries, optimizing weight and structural integrity is essential to decreasing the weight and reducing the amount of gas being used per trip. This optimization is extremely impactful for the effectiveness of the product. The premium opportunity that generative AI offers is insanely great for product development in any industry where optimization is necessary.

### How does Generative Design Work?

Generative Design is an iterative process that harnesses algorithm-based software to generate numerous designs based on constraints like material properties, performance requirements, and weight specifications. The primary utility of generative Design lies in its ability to explore the vast design space that a human designer might not consider, efficiently finding solutions that optimize weight, material usage, and structural integrity. This approach is useful and could be regarded as essential for industries like aerospace, where weight is a premium concern. It has been instrumental in designing parts that balance strength and weight, resulting in fuel-efficient aircraft with a reduced carbon footprint.

### What are some drawbacks of Generative Design?

There are some drawbacks to generative Design. The main drawback is that the ability of Generative Design to explore solutions is restricted by manufacturing methods—such methods as filament 3D printing, injection molding, and laser cutting—which may hinder the ability of the Generative Design Algorithm. In addition, generative Design can be costly, especially for non-educational users. For Fusion 360, it costs $25 for each generation and $100 to export a model from the study. Additionally, generative Design is very limited by knowledge of the forces applied. It is crucial to know what type of force, at what degree, at what angle, and which specific parts it affects. It may be a hindering factor in the ability of generative Design.

## The Revolutionary Manufacturing method: Powder Bed Fusion (PBF)

PBF offers a unique additive manufacturing opportunity when coupled with generative AI, where the generative AI can be set to 'unrestrictive' given the ability of the PBF to print pretty much anywhere in the powder. PFG uses thermal energy to selectively fuse regions of a powder bed, and the powder then supports the fused powder parts, meaning that the print can produce complex geometries with essentially no wasted material as support. In other words, PBF's unique manufacturing ability to print virtually any object without support material gives leeway. It resolves generative design restrictions using the manufacturing method. The digital models outputted by the generative Design, given PBF's cool manufacturing freedom, have insane weight optimization and the toughness of materials like Nylon 12 and ALSi10Mg. The combination of PBF with generative Design is a unique combination capable of making strong, lightweight, and cost-effective geometries.

Furthermore, the iterative nature of generative Design aligns well with PBF's rapid prototyping capabilities. Designs can be quickly manufactured, tested, and refined in successive iterations, creating a feedback loop that can rapidly hone in on optimal design solutions. This easy integration between PBF, generative Design, and rapid prototyping makes for a very quick development process and prototyping—essential for fast-paced industries like automotive and startups, where time-to-market and getting the fastest MVP are critical factors.

Generative Design coupled with PBF can lead to optimal solutions for complex problems by minimizing weight, especially for aerospace and the automotive sector. Generative Design can optimize the car's chassis for crashworth
