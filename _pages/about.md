## About 

I abide by three rules in life; first, work harder than everyone else; second, be ready for what life brings; and third, have fun! As an employee, I can guarantee I will work hard, prepare for whatever job or assignment is given, and be a curious, passionate, and dedicated employee. 

I believe in the idea "One must have a direction to change directions." In other words, I plan to obtain a Ph.D. in some field of Biology or Chemistry to accomplish great feats and improve the circumstances of our world. 

## Objective Statement 

I hope to work in the biotechnology industry for product development or invent something profitable
